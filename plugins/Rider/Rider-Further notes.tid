* There is ''no undo'', nor is there a confirmation when submitting or abandoning changes.
* Enabling the Editor Toolbar activates a lot of functionality in the editor, beyond the obvious formatting, including [[excising text into a new tiddler|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Using%20Excise]] and editor operation plugins like Saq Imtiaz's freaky-fun [[Editor Autolists|https://saqimtiaz.github.io/sq-tw/editor-autolists.html]], which is also demoed in [[Dave Gifford's Stroll|https://giffmex.org/stroll/goodies.html#Outliner]].
* The text editor preview mode is not implemented within the ''rider'' plugin.
* Nesting any sort of transclusion opens the possibility of recursion errors.
